## Overview
The "Heart Failure Prediction" project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of heart failure based on various numerical features. This project utilizes a dataset containing various health-related metrics to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of numerical data related to patients' health. The features include:

- *Age*: Age of the patient
- *Sex*: Gender of the patient
- *Chest Pain Type*: Type of chest pain experienced
- *Resting Blood Pressure*: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg
- *Cholesterol*: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- *Fasting Blood Sugar*: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
- *Resting ECG*: Resting electrocardiographic results
- *Max Heart Rate*: Maximum heart rate achieved
- *Exercise Induced Angina*: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- *Oldpeak*: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- *Slope*: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- *Ca*: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- *Thal*: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
- *Target*: Presence of heart disease (0 = no; 1 = yes)

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the dependencies using pip:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. *Data Preprocessing*: Prepare the data for training by running the data preprocessing script.

bash
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py


2. *Model Training*: Train the machine learning model using the training script.
bash
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py


2. *Model Training*: Train the machine learning model using the training script.

bash
python scripts/model_training.py


3. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluate the performance of the trained model.

bash
python scripts/model_evaluation.py


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA.ipynb notebook contains detailed exploratory data analysis of the dataset. It includes visualizations and insights about the features and their relationships with the target variable.

## Model Training
The Model_Training.ipynb notebook covers the training process of the machine learning models. Various models are trained and their performances are compared to select the best model.

## Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are documented and visualized in the Model_Evaluation.ipynb notebook.
